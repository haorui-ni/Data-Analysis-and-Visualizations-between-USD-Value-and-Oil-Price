# DSCI510_FinalProject
The name of my final project is "Correlation between the USD value and the crude oil price between 2013-2022". In this project, I intend to explore how dollar value and oil prices fluctuate over time, whether there is a correlation between them, and whether the correlation changed over time. There are three data sources involved in this proejct: The US dollar index historical dataset, the WTI crude oil stock data, and the Brent crude oil stock data. To achive my research goal, I would use statistical methods and make visualizations.
